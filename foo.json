    "text": "Introduction\nA sandwich is a type of food that consists of two slices of bread that have a\nfilling, usually consisting of a slice of meat, vegetables, cheese and other\ncondiments.\nSandwiches are extremely versatile and can also be filled with whatever\ningredient you wish, be it jam, fruit, egg, hotdog, chocolate or ice cream.\nSandwiches can further be broken down into types depending on how they\nare presented. For example, an open-faced sandwich is where the slice of\nbread is topped with the filling and served as is. Pinwheel sandwich uses a\ntype of flatbread that is rolled together with the filling and is cut crosswise.\nSandwiches are a very popular lunch food and as snacks on-the-go.\nHamburgers or burgers are a type of sandwich. They are \nundoubtedly one of\nthe most popular foods in the world, thanks to popular fast-food chains.\nBurgers typically contain a patty of ground beef together with lettuce, tomato,\nbacon, onion, cheese and condiments. Although burgers usually pertain to\nbeef, any type of meat can be used as a substitute."

It is served with tomatoes, bell pepper, onions, pickles, olive\noil, olives and provolone."
